# Before you start 
Make sure you download ffmpeg from their official page at [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/).

# Running
On windows just run Kutter.exe from the release folder Qt is statically linked and should work right away.

# Compiling on your own
Download Qt, Mingw and follow the steps at [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html). 
If you want to use statically linked dlls make sure to compile Qt first.
